# Task2
It's based on sentiment analysis with nlp

Excited to share that I’ve wrapped up a project focused on Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)! This was a hands-on deep dive into how machines can understand and classify human emotions from text.

📌 Project Highlights:

▫️Preprocessed raw text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

▫️Built a model to classify text as positive, negative

▫️Used techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings

▫️Trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

▫️Achieved strong accuracy on real-world datasets like movie or product reviews

This experience really highlighted the power of combining linguistics and machine learning to extract meaning from messy, unstructured data. 🚀
